        <p>Onion rings generally consist of a cross-sectional "ring" of onion dipped in batter or bread crumbs and then deep fried.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 qt oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
            <li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
            <li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
